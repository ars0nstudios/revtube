# clipIt: video sharing
## If you are looking to host this yourself, and you do not want the UI changes, commit [6c606d8](https://github.com/catrilldev/revtube/commit/6c606d8010515ab18c560225570d544bcfdd9677) is the last to not have these changes. If you do want the UI changes, ignore this.

*UI formerly maintaned by Cattskit, now maintained by jkosixtyfour/ky-1.*

clipIt (formerly RevTube/VistaTube) is a video <!--(with audio uploading a feature that was going to be added)--> sharing site designed as an alternative to YouTube and similar sites.
*Name used with the permission of Chaziz.*
# Access the site
