# RevTube: PHP video sharing software
## DO NOT USE THIS RIGHT NOW, IT'S CURRENTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PROVIDED SQL FILE

## If you are looking to host this yourself, and you do not want the UI changes, commit [6c606d8](https://github.com/catrilldev/revtube/commit/6c606d8010515ab18c560225570d544bcfdd9677) is the last to not have these changes. If you do want the UI changes (mainly to the uploader), ignore this.

*UI formerly maintaned by Cattskit, now maintained by kylarz/ky-1.*

RevTube is a video <!--(with audio uploading a feature that was going to be added)--> sharing site designed as an alternative to YouTube and similar sites.
# Access the site 
<!--You can access RevTube at https://rev.yoretude.com.-->
<!--~~For the upcoming "Redux" layout, the link is: https://redst0ne.xyz/vistatuberedux~~ (Redux is cancelled)
For the current "skeuo" layout, the link is https://rev.yoretude.com.

RevTube is currently in development, so we do not have a public instance at this time.
# Changelog (only shows latest major update)
## January 12, 2024
The RevTube branding has been restored. (Also it's been a little over 2 years since this project started so that's neat, I guess.)
