# RevTube
RevTube was a video (with audio uploading a feature that was going to be added) sharing site designed as an alternative to YouTube and similar sites.
# Access the site 
As of February 5, 2022, the RevTube project has been terminated. You are allowed to fork this repo if you want to continue it, however the developer (jko64) has decided to move on with a new project in the works.
