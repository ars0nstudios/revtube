# SkyTube
SkyTube (formerly RevTube/VistaTube) is a video <!--(with audio uploading a feature that was going to be added)--> sharing site designed as an alternative to YouTube and similar sites.
# Access the site 
<!--You can access RevTube at https://rev.yoretude.com.-->
<!--~~For the upcoming "Redux" layout, the link is: https://redst0ne.xyz/vistatuberedux~~ (Redux is cancelled)

SkyTube is currently in development, so we do not have a public instance at this time.
# Changelog (only shows latest major update)
## February 16, 2022
RevTube has officially been rebranded to SkyTube! This comes with a redesigned navbar. Also, videos are now accessed via random 11 character strings, like YouTube. For example, watch.php?id=1 becomes something like watch.php?v=qGfP2PtcI6M
