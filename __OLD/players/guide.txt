2014 player patch, by genosmrpg7899#4308, modifications and guide by «John»#1234

player files are mostly hosted locally but you still need an internet connection for the player to work.

load a video by opening embed.php?v=<video filename without extension> in your browser

you can edit get_video_info.php to manually load files. it's human readable and formatted.

make sure html5_player_template is in the same directory as the player itself, along with get_video_info.

video files are placed in /videos.
thumbnails are placed in /thumbs.
the thumbnail and video file names must be the same, and thumbnails must be in PNG format, or the player won't find them.

this version of the player was designed to work on macOS, and should work on linux. windows support is not guaranteed.
