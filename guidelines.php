            <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
            <ul class="unstyled">
            <li>Harassment will <b><em>not</em></b> be tolerated in any way. If you are found harassing people (including doxxing, this is a common issue on other sites), we reserve the right to delete your video or comment, and if it continues, your account can be deleted.</li>
<br>
<li>You <b>MUST</b> be at least 13 years of age to use this website. If you are found to be under that age, we will delete your account and all associated data regardless of how many strikes you have.</li>
</ul>            
<h2>Uploading Guidelines</h2>
            <ul class="unstyled">
            <li>NSFW/NSFL (Not Safe For Work/Life) content (porn of any kind (legal or not), gore, etc) is absolutely not allowed, and if your account is found to have uploaded this kind of video, you can face: video deletion and strike, account deletion, temporary IP ban, or permanent IP ban.</li>
<br>
<li>Additionally, corrupted videos, defined as videos that cannot be played, will be deleted.</li>
<br>
<li>Shitposting is generally frowned upon, as it adds no value to our site. It is not necessarily against the rules however.</li>
<br>            
</ul>
            <h2>Commenting Guidelines</h2>
            <ul class="unstyled">
            <li>Leaving multiple comments with no purpose or spamming will get your comment(s) deleted.</li>
<br>
<li>Posting links to your videos or profiles (links that lead off-platform included) is not allowed and carries the same punishment as above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Strike System</h2>
        <ul class="unstyled">
            <li>Generally, an infraction (instance of breaking one of these rules) will give you 1 strike.</li><br><li> Unless it's something more severe (illegal content for example), you'll only get one strike for every infraction.</li><br><li> If you have 2 strikes, you lose your ability to upload/comment (depending on which rules you broke).</li><br><li>When your account reaches 3 strikes, it will be deleted along with all your videos and comments.</li><br><li> We cannot (and probably wouldn't even if we could) undo this so try not to get that far.</li<br>
