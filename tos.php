<br>
<li><strong>NO NSFL CONTENT.</strong> Including all types of gore, propaganda, and child porn (goes with no nsfw aswell).</li>
<br>

            <h2>Commenting Rules</h2>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li>Please, don't be a jackass/smartass/"edgy kid". It doesn't help anyone, and it's certainly not needed. Doing so will result in your comment deleted and if you keep it up, we'll delete your account (This can also lead to a IP ban).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> spam comments. All that does is clog the comment section and database, which we do not need.</li>
