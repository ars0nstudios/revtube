<h2>Section 1 - How to install & basic setup</h2>
<p>To setup SkyTube:
    <ul>
        <li>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/cosmixcode/revtube">GitHub Repo</a> into your webservers public_html or htdocs folder (on Linux, it's /var/www/html)</li>
        <li>Make a new SQL database</li>
        <li>Import the SQL file located at <code>sql/db.sql</code> into your database</li>
        <li>Edit the file <code>assets/mod/db.php</code> to include your database credentials</li>
    </ul>
If all these steps were followed correctly, your instance should look like this:
